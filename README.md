# Plex
A universal remote spy script. (now open sourced)
## Prologue
This in no way represents how I (or Opelika, probably) program today. This is a *mess*, and I've moved on from certain practices I've used in this script. This is for educational purposes only, so feel free to learn from it (although I don't recommend doing so). Also, this probably won't even work, so use it at your own discretion.
## Script
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xTask/Plex/main/main.lua"))()
```
## Settings
- [Fonts](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/Font) (default is SourceSans)
- Theme (Dark or Light)
- AdvancedMode (I don't know what this does, Opelika added this.)
## Usage
- Open your executor of choice
- Load the script
- Execute
